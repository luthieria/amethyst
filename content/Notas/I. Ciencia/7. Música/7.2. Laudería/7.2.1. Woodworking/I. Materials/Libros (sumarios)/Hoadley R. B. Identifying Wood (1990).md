# Introduction

- Identification is based on:
  - main:
    1. **anatomy** = cellular structure;
  - secondary (used sometimes):
    2. **color**;
    3. **odor**;
    4. **density**.

<br>

- Most woods aren't identifiable with an unaided eye (= by tissues = cells seen en masse).
- Some woods are identifiable by their distinct combination of growth rings and rays.
- Identification of most hardwoods:
  1. expose the cell structure with a very sharp cut (e.g., a single-edged razor blade);
  2. examine with a low-power magnifier (e.g., 10×-power hand lens).
- Some woods require examination of individual cells / details of cell walls with a microscope.

## Example

- **Rays** — relatively straight, light-colored lines (running vertically through the photo) composed of imperceptibly small ray cells.
  - Most are inconspicuously fine. 2 are bold.
- **Growth rings** — repeating bands of cells perpendicular to the rays.
- **Pores** — cells large enough to be seen individually within growth rings.
  - Exist only in hardwoods.
  - **Ring-porous** wood — the largest pores are concentrated in one portion of a growth ring.
- The rest of the cells are too small to be individually distinct, but their lighter and darker masses are arranged in characteristic patters.

1. Try identifying by a simple visual match.
2. If a sample is uncertain, use a microscope:
   1. slice off an ultrathin piece of wood with a razor blade;
   2. put it on glass microscope slide in a drop of water and top with a cover glass (see Chapter 7);
   3. examine the cells.
      - E.g., 
        - red oak: the smaller pores are solitary (— don't touch other pores) and thick-walled;
        - white oak: small pores are grouped in ≥2 and thin-walled.
