A “P-scale” grading indicates a uniform cutting surface.
  - E.g., P220 = 220 sand pieces per inch².

## Types

1. **Free** — sheet.[^https://youtu.be/ntsiNsaaNHM?si=pd6p8qkQc0LLtv4q]
2. **Roll**.
3. **Circle** — for sanders.

## Wet[^Erlewine283]

- Lubricant: water.
- All wet-or-dry sandpapers should be soaked overnight — for the particles rinse out easily (otherwise they load up and wear out almost immediately).
- Best: Japanese (e.g., “Finesse”).
  - Aggressive: P800 cuts like P400, but doesn’t leave scratches.
  - Store in water when not in use. Lasts ~ 1 week before disintegrating.
