# Foreword

- Genesis:
  - XVIII c. — baroque guitar;
  - XIX c. —XIX-century guitar[^Luthiers];
  - romantic guitar (Torres).

- The baroque guitar's sound is of an alto instrument; the bass was often suggested, not pointed.

- 1790s — removal of double strings, addition of a bass string; → the guitar transitioned from being an alto instrument to a seemingly bass one (guitar's tessitura roughly corresponded to that of the violoncello).
  - Little to no changes in the sound chamber (which would have accommodated the new low frequencies) occurred.

- Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909) brought the suitar into the romantic era. Without the Torres' design, Tárrega’s contribution to guitar technique would have been minimal.
