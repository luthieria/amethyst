# Foreword

- Genesis:
  - XVIII c. — baroque guitar;
  - XIX c. —XIX-century guitar[^Luthiers];
  - romantic guitar (Torres).

<br>

- The baroque guitar's sound is of an alto instrument; the bass was often suggested, not pointed.

<br>

- 1790s — removal of double strings, addition of a bass string; → the guitar transitioned from being an alto instrument to a seemingly bass one (guitar's tessitura roughly corresponded to that of the violoncello).
  - Little to no changes in the sound chamber (which would have accommodated the new low frequencies) occurred.

<br>

- Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909) brought the suitar into the romantic era. Without the Torres' design, Tárrega’s contribution to guitar technique would have been minimal.

# PART I. Life and Times
## 2. Sevilla

- Torres "was a calm, serious-minded man. He spoke slowly and his penetrating eyes reflected his great intelligence. He was a poet whose compositions he read to us at intimate gatherings, compositions that aroused our admiration in which, although by then an old man (68 years), still revealed a youthful spirit. He was a fine musician and composer whose compositions he revealed to us with his Cítara, his favorite instrument which he had also made himself."

<br>

- Torres: ==the secret to the sonority is only in the soundboard: the wood's condition, form, and the working of it==.
- Torres: "...it is impossible for me to leave the secret behind for posterity <...> ...==it is the result of the feel of the tips of the thumb and forefinger communicating to my intellect whether the soundboard is properly worked out== to correspond with the guitar maker's concept and the sound required of the instrument.”
- ==For the boxes (i.e., soundboard, ribs, and back) and necks he used the wood from very old pieces of furniture.==

#### Sevilla
- Sevilla's Francisco Sanguino, José Pagés, Joseph Benedid, Francisco Pérez, the élite of the XVIII-century luthiers, made instruments by far more advanced techniques than those of the Granada luthiers.

- Francisco Sanguino was ahead of his contemporaries and with obvious awareness of the acoustical properties of his materials: 
  - 1759 — used a typical fan-strut arrangement (5 struts + 2 diagonal);
  - enlarged body;
  - purflings and inlays on the top and back;
  - produced a musical instrument rather than an objet d'art (unlike some of his colleagues).

- José Pagés used all Sanguino's innovations and added a soundboard doming with the struts.
  - José Recio, Antonio de Torres (FE 03), Francisco González followed this doming.

#### Influence on Torres

- Some of the ideas that Torres developed were already evident in the guitars of Francisco Sanguino, José Pagés, (to a lesser degree) Manuel Gutiérrez of Sevilla and Antonio Giménez de Soto of Vera. 
- → Torres’ guitars have more affinity with guitars made in Cadiz and Sevilla than with those of Pernas. It's unlikely that Torres derived his innovations from the Granada luthiers.

#### ***

- Throughout his life Torres had been greatly respected, not only as a guitar maker but as a human being and he was considered by his own family as a man of sound moral principles.

<br>

- Sevilla was a major city, → permitted Torres obtain all the exotic materials.
- The Sevilla years is the Torres' creative peak.

<br>

- **1854** — FE 02, one of the earliest surviving guitars: Torres was still learning his craft.
- **1856** — La Leona, one of the first to have a tornavoz.
- **1858** — FE 08, Torres' most beautiful guitar: masterly wood inlays for ornaments.
- **1859** — the guitar for Miguel Llobet.
- **1864** — the 1st guitar for Francisco Tárrega.
