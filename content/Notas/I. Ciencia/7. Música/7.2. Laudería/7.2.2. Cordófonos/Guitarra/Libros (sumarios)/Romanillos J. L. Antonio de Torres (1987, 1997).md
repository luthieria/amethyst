# Foreword

- Genesis:
  - XVIII c. — baroque guitar;
  - XIX c. —XIX-century guitar[^Luthiers];
  - romantic guitar (Torres).

<br>

- The baroque guitar's sound is of an alto instrument; the bass was often suggested, not pointed.

<br>

- 1790s — removal of double strings, addition of a bass string; → the guitar transitioned from being an alto instrument to a seemingly bass one (guitar's tessitura roughly corresponded to that of the violoncello).
  - Little to no changes in the sound chamber (which would have accommodated the new low frequencies) occurred.

<br>

- Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909) brought the suitar into the romantic era. Without the Torres' design, Tárrega’s contribution to guitar technique would have been minimal.

# PART I. Life and Times
## 2. Sevilla

- Torres "was a calm, serious-minded man. He spoke slowly and his penetrating eyes reflected his great intelligence. He was a poet whose compositions he read to us at intimate gatherings, compositions that aroused our admiration in which, although by then an old man (68 years), still revealed a youthful spirit. He was a fine musician and composer whose compositions he revealed to us with his Cítara, his favorite instrument which he had also made himself."

<br>

- Torres: ==the secret to the sonority is only in the soundboard: the wood's condition, form, and the working of it==.
- Torres: "...it is impossible for me to leave the secret behind for posterity <...> ...==it is the result of the feel of the tips of the thumb and forefinger communicating to my intellect whether the soundboard is properly worked out== to correspond with the guitar maker's concept and the sound required of the instrument.”
- ==For the boxes (i.e., soundboard, ribs, and back) and necks he used the wood from very old pieces of furniture.==

#### Sevilla
- Sevilla's Francisco Sanguino, José Pagés, Joseph Benedid, Francisco Pérez, the élite of the XVIII-century luthiers, made instruments by far more advanced techniques than those of the Granada luthiers.

- Francisco Sanguino was ahead of his contemporaries and with obvious awareness of the acoustical properties of his materials: 
  - 1759 — used a typical fan-strut arrangement (5 struts + 2 diagonal);
  - enlarged body;
  - purflings and inlays on the top and back;
  - produced a musical instrument rather than an objet d'art (unlike some of his colleagues).

- José Pagés used all Sanguino's innovations and added a soundboard doming with the struts.
  - José Recio, Antonio de Torres (FE 03), Francisco González followed this doming.

#### Influence on Torres

- Some of the ideas that Torres developed were already evident in the guitars of Francisco Sanguino, José Pagés, (to a lesser degree) Manuel Gutiérrez of Sevilla and Antonio Giménez de Soto of Vera. 
- → Torres’ guitars have more affinity with guitars made in Cadiz and Sevilla than with those of Pernas. It's unlikely that Torres derived his innovations from the Granada luthiers.

#### ***

- Throughout his life Torres had been greatly respected, not only as a guitar maker but as a human being and he was considered by his own family as a man of sound moral principles.

<br>

- Sevilla was a major city, → permitted Torres obtain all the exotic materials.
- The Sevilla years is the Torres' creative peak.

<br>

- **1854** — FE 02, one of the earliest surviving guitars: Torres was still learning his craft.
- **1856** — La Leona, one of the first to have a tornavoz.
- **1858** — FE 08, Torres' most beautiful guitar: masterly wood inlays for ornaments.
- **1859** — the guitar for Miguel Llobet.
- **1864** — the 1st guitar for Francisco Tárrega.

## 3. The Return to Almeria

- "From his workshop, with its large window looking out towards the Mediterranean, Torres must have heard, while working on his instruments, the faint sound of a sea that he could just make out between the rows of slender cypress trees standing guard over the vale of La Cañada—some of which would furnish Torres with the material he needed for his guitars. Torres must have heard, too, the voices of farmhands and day-laborers toiling in the adjacent fields; the same villagers who at times would gather to hear Torres try out his instruments."
- "Torres was a practicing Christian who sought comfort in the Catholic faith..."

<br>

- **1883** — the 2nd guitar for Francisco Tárrega.
  - Back, ribs: flamed maple.
  - No tornavoz.
  - Worse tone. → Tárrega returned to the 1st one.

<br>

- Best guitars have 7 fan-struts.

<br>

- Torres used silver:
  -  frets (some guitars);
  -  nut, saddle, frets, machine heads (FE 08).

## 4. The Nineteenth Century and After

- **Late XVIII century** — the craft guilds' power over the artisans weakened, allowing for a freer production of musical instruments. $\Rightarrow$ 
- **Early XIX century** — innovation period of the guitar.

### Innovations

- **1797** (Benito Sanchez de Aguilera) — plantilla (body shape) got greater differentiation between the bouts' sizes.

<br>

- **XVIII century** — Francisco Sanguino (Sevilla) invented the fan strutting.
  - **Early XIX century** — Madrid adopted the fan strutting.

<br>

- Single-string course:
  - **1801** — the first mention of single-string course guitars, in Ronda (Málaga province) villages;
  - **1803** — Agustin Caro (Granada) was already making single-string course guitars;
  - Juan Muñoa (1783-1824) — likely among the first Madrid luthiers to make single-string course guitars.

<br>

- Dionisio Aguado’s influence over Manuel and Juan Muñoa was likely the turning point towards the modern concert guitar in Spain:
  - **early XIX century** — bridge with a saddle (self-attributed by Dionisio Aguado); raised fingerboard.

<br>

- **1830** — Juan Moreno (Madrid) arched the soundboard, breaking the tradition of flat-tabled guitars.
  - Influenced many of the guitarras de tablao (guitars used for flamenco) by, e.g., Francisco González, José and Manuel Ramírez, Salvador Ibañez.

<br>

- **Francisco González** (Madrid):
  - walnut: flat soundboard, no struts;
  - rosewood: arched, 3–7 struts;
    - arched by means of an arched lower harmonic bar below the soundhole (in some guitars, ≤28 mm).

<br>

- 1856 — Torres created an opened harmonic bar below the soundhole.
- 1863 — Eustaquio Torralba made a variation: replaced the harmonic bar with a complicated asymmetrical grid of bars and struts.

### José Ramírez I (1858-1923)
- Learned from Francisco González the typical *guitarra de tablao* principles and followed them:
  - large body, 
  - rigid, highly arched soundboard (developed mainly for the flamenco players of the *tablaos*, popular during the heyday of the *café cantantes*).

### Manuel Ramírez (1864-1916)
- Learned from José Ramírez I but followed the newer Torres principles of a lighter guitar.
- Some of his *guitarras de tablao* followed closely those of José Ramírez I. Some followed Torres.
- By many considered the most influential luthier since Torres.

<br>

- **Struts**:
  - **shape**:
    - Torres' finish and gable-ended shape;
    /
    - rounded;
  - **amount**: 5–8.
- **Ornaments**: Torres' influence.

<br>

- Influences on a certain (?) guitar of his:
  - Torres: plantilla shape and size, light construction, 8 struts, 3-piece spruce top;
  - José Ramírez I: a rounded-wing bridge (unlike the orthodox squared-wing bridge (used by Torres)).
- Varied the fan strutting: e.g., 3-piece tops don't have a central joint, $\Rightarrow$ omitted the central strut (probably influencing Vicente Arias).

<br>

- **1912** — guitar for González Campos.
  - Campos was an Andalucian guitarist, $\Rightarrow$ that's probably why it appears to be a Torres replica:
    - apertures in the lower harmonic bar;
    - 2 outside struts on each side of the soundboard, extending into the soundhole area;
    - plantilla similar to the late 1880s large Torres guitars;

<br>

- Trained (on the Torres principles):
  - Santos Hernández;
  - Enrique García;
  - Domingo Esteso;
  - Modesto Borreguero;
  - Antonio Emilio Pascual Viudes.

### Santos Hernández

- Subtly varied the Manuel Ramírez's design: innovated with the slanted harmonic bar on the soundboard's treble side (later used by Ignacio Fleta, José Ramírez III, Miguel Rodríguez).

<br>

- **1912** — guitar for Giménez Manjón, but presented to then-unknown Andrés Segovia.
  - Made by Santos Hernández in Manuel Ramírez's workshop.
  - Made for 11 strings, but converted to 6 before being presented to Segovia: 
    - plugged holes in the head's back;
    - wider, longer neck block.

### Enrique García

- Torres' influence: 
  - extremely wide rosettes and purflings;
  - plantillas;
  - tornavoz;
  - 7-strut fan.

<br>

- Prat introduced García's instruments into Argentina. Argentina especially praised García guitars.

### Francisco Simplicio 

- Enrique García's student.
- At one stage, made guitars similar in design and ornamentation to those of García.
- Often used the tornavoz.

### Ignacio Fleta

-
