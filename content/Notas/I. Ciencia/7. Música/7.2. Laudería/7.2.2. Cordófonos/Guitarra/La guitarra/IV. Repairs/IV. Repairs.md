# Tuning Stability Factors

1. Thick, expensive strings.
2. Tinning the string wrapping.
3. Correct stringing technique adequate for the particular tuner type.
4. Locking tuners.

5. Lower action.
6. Not fretting strings too hard.
7. Higher string tension.
8. Strings designed for the desired tuning (definitely not for a tuning higher than that).
9. Longer scale.
