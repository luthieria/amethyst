- [^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]Essential (cover almost all wood finishing situations):
  1. “**film**” — hard, protective coating on top of wood:
     1. **oil-based satin polyurethane**;
     2. **clear shellac**;
  2. **oil** — sinks into the wood, little coating on top of wood:
     1. **boiled linseed** oil.

- Don’t finish in a dusty environment (use, e.g., your kitchen).[^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]
- Keep #0000 steel wool in paste wax jar — usable for almost any project (linseed oil, shellac).[^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]

## Linseed Oil[^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]

- Dries fast (1 day).
- Applicable with a simple cloth rag.
- Usually, 1 coat is enough.

<br>

- Beautiful: darkens, accentuates the grain. → Can be used as an undercoat for almost any film finish: dry ~ 12 hours before the film.
- Great for rejuvenating old wood (e.g., tool handles).

<br>

- Heats up, → can combust. → Spread on the cement floor to dry ~ 12 hours before throwing it away.

### Application

1. Wipe on 1 coat.
2. Leave it to soak for ~ 10 minutes.
3. Wipe it off.
4. Wipe on a bit of paste wax.
 
<br>

- Apply more on endgrain (← it soaks in more).

## Shellac[^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]

- Dries fast (10 minutes). → Hard to fix mistakes (just move on to the next coat).
- Non-toxic as soon as cured.
- Durable.
- Feels great in hand. → Great for tool handles.
- Easy to work with.
 
<br>

- Forms:
  1. **flakes** — to be mixed with denatured alcohol;
  2. **liquid**.

## Polyurethane[^https://youtu.be/JQA-EbQ2EGk?si=Q07A2SgTjNFEozPE]

- Types:
  1. **water-based**;
     - very clear;
  2. **oil-based** — slightly more durable;
     - slight amber hue — almost always improves the wood appearance.

### Oil-Based

- Maximum protection.
- For wood, bare steel.[^https://youtu.be/322EiA40cT4?si=QwDMRejaHfSrP6t_]

<br>

- Heats up, → can combust. → Spread on the cement floor to dry ~ 12 hours before throwing it away.

<br>

- Difficult to clean brushes: with mineral spirits, soapy water.
  - Always a good practice: thin by mixing in ~ 10% of mineral spirits.
    - Prevents bubbles.
    - Needs 4 instead of 3 coats.

#### Application

- Apply each coat by brushing 2× with a mostly dry brush.
- Coat 1 is a sealer, → can apply fast, doesn’t need careful application.
- The first 2 coats raise the grain.

<br>

1. Sand the wood.
2. Wipe off the dust with a paper towel soaked in mineral spirits.
3. Day 1.
   1. Morning: coat 1.
   2. Dry 2 hours.
   3. Afternoon: coat 2.
   4. Remove raised grain.
      1. P220.
      2. Wipe off the dust with a paper towel soaked in mineral spirits.
4. Day 2.
      - Greater care — these coats are the most visible.
      - Make the surface horizontal before application — to avoid drips.
      - Apply under sunlight — to see uneven spots.
   1. Morning: coat 3.
   2. Dry 2 hours.
   3. Afternoon: coat 4.
   4. Dry ~ 12 hours.
5. Day 3.
   1. P220, P320.
   2. Wipe off the dust.
   3. Apply paste wax with #0000 steel wool.
   4. Buff with a soft cotton / microfiber cloth.
