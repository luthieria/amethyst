# Characteristics
## Grain

- **Wood grain** = **tree rings**.[^Kert]

- Rings alternate between:
  - light, wide — grown at spring (trees grow faster);
  - dark, narrow, dense — grown in autumn (trees grow slower).

- Wood consists of long cellulose fibers bound together by a glue-like lignin. Splitting cellulose is harder than lignin. → Wood is stronger along the grain.

- All strength measurements are averages.

#### Specific Gravity

- **Specific gravity** = **density** calculated by comparing the same volume of wood and water. Water’s specific gravity is 1.0. A specific gravity <1.0 means that the wood floats.
- Important for, e.g., boats.

- Poplar — 0.42.
- Cherry — 0.50.
- Walnut — 0.55.
- Yellow pine — 0.59.
- Hard maple — 0.63.
- White oak — 0.68.
- Ebony — 1.0. → Sinks.
