- Wood is basically cellulose microfibrils bonded together by a “natural glue” lignin. → Glueing the broken wood back together is quite “natural”.[^https://youtu.be/R8R2DXlqVgU?si=OiApUudeAoMCixtA]

<br>

- [^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]Time:
  - **open** (← “open joint”) — the glue remains liquid and workable;
    - joining parts after the open time results in a weak bond;[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue]
  - **assembly** — open time + the time one has to manoeuvre the pieces after joining them together.
- **Glue starvation** — over-clamping causing the glue to come out of the joint. It will hold for a while (~25 years) before coming apart.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]

<br>

- [^https://youtu.be/Qk11FJMLUUc?si=iWTnCWesuUf60A-4&t=516]Bonding to itself:
  - hot / liquid hide glue — yes;
  - PVA, epoxy — no.

<br>

- Water-based glues (e.g., Titebond Original) are dyeable with water-soluble dye. If it’s powder, mix it with water first.[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

<br>

- Lubricate the pins / threads with a paste wax to avoid glueing them.[^https://youtu.be/5-ol31YUOD0?si=NxIz2uF_LjF_4HdO]
- Cover a surface with a packing tape to avoid glueing it.[^https://youtu.be/5-ol31YUOD0?si=NxIz2uF_LjF_4HdO]

<br>

- Excess glue (e.g., on braces) can affect tone. → Clean up everything to be neat.[^https://youtu.be/7ClFeZ769BE?si=sB12-Im_ABrwUXmG]

## i.i. Hide

### Hot[^https://youtu.be/ER1T5zMKG-g?si=TsHSYwHjxESBmPWN][^https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/glue-and-adhesive/glues/wood-glues/stewmac-ground-hide-glue/]

#### Description

{{< expand "To do" >}}

Sumarizar: [Luthier Tips du Jour Mailbag 9 -  Hide Glue](https://youtu.be/stpmQfLrQPo?si=OxXlBS8mJTT1EFqV)

{{< /expand >}}

- Used since Ancient Mesopotamia = since the beginning of civilization (as opposed to PVA that appeared only after WWII). → Time-approved.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]

<br>

- Synthetic glues work mechanically, → leave a skim inside the joint, acting like velcro. Hot hide glue is protein-based, → the proteins absorb into the wood, “stitching” the cellular structure together as the long-chain proteins form.[^https://youtu.be/iYoLUvZ9SH8?si=ezupJB3IHDzvo71_]

##### Advantages

1. **Repairability**:undoable cleanly an infinite number of times (with heat, moisture, hot knife), → makes an instrument repairable (as opposed to synthetic glues which may ruin the instrument).
2. For the **strongest** joints.
3. **No creep** under pressure (as opposed to PVA, which creates plastic joints that creep over time under heavy loads[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue]).
4. **Cleans easily** with heat / steam / hot water.
5. Creates a somewhat brittle joint, → **cleanly breaks along the joint** (as opposed to PVA, which damages the glued surfaces[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue]).
6. **Bonds to itself**, reactivates older hide glue.
7. **Functions as its own clamp**: once it begins to gel, it pulls the joint together.
8. **No glue starvation**.
9. **Good vibration** (→ tone) **transfer**.
10. **Very short working time**.
11. **Transparent**, → makes cracks invisible.

##### Disadvantages

1. Short open time.
2. Working time (before gelling up) — 2–3 minutes.
3. Thermal limitations.
4. Vulnerability to micro-organisms.

##### * * *

- Hide glue is just a liquid, → flows properly, → doesn’t need to be applied onto both surfaces (it will only produce more squeeze).[^https://youtu.be/tWKU0nM2LPE?si=dlqtNrHxe0yvUARW]

<br>

- The best glue for old instruments.
  - Used for violins since the XVI c.[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue+https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041320/http://www.karlroyviolinbook.com/pdfs/Glue211-213.pdf]; old Martins, Gibsons.[^https://youtu.be/Raq3pbGmmOg?si=5RVyck1gUGWAdab2]
  - Violin family instruments require periodic disassembly for maintenance. The top is easily removed by prying a palette knife between the top and ribs, and running it all around the joint. To reglue, just apply new hot hide glue to the joint. (If the top were glued on with PVA, removing the top would require heat and steam to disassemble the joint, damaging the varnish; then wood would have to be removed from the joint to ensure no cured PVA glue was remaining before re-gluing the top.)[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue]
  - Violin makers may glue the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide glue, and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide glue starts to gel, at which point the glue becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide glue pulls the joint together as it hardens.[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue]

<br>

- [^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]The higher the gram strength, the stronger the glue.
  - Recommended:
    - 120–200[^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue#Hide_glue];
      - 192 — most musical instruments, [StewMac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/glue-and-adhesive/glues/wood-glues/stewmac-ground-hide-glue/?queryid=1781298a716ba6dd2f75497ebc683f02);
    - 315 — preferred by M. E. Bruné because it is strong enough to pull together imperfect joints.

<br>

- According to M. E. Bruné, it is the only glue luthiers must use.[^https://youtu.be/UK6wONlZjDo?si=w_NxIUA446pZHIEi]
  - M. E. Bruné uses Milligan & Higgins.[^https://youtu.be/iYoLUvZ9SH8?si=I7ETT5Dd9800efH3]
- Dan Erlewine’s, Gene’s favorite. Dan Erlewine uses it whenever its working time allows.

<br>

- Heat extends the glue's proteins.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]
- [^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]Operation t°F: 100–145.
  - Above that, the proteins denature (= come apart).
- Hot water seals off the collagen preventing the glue from blooming.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]
- Works by absorbing into the wood and, as its proteins contract, they pull the joint together (as opposed to PVA relying on its thickness, which makes it fallible to glue starvation).[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]

<br>

- Don’t add adulterants (urea, urea formaldehyde). It extends open time, but makes the glue act like a synthetic one (= extend in the joint) when in a warm environment.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]

#### Usage[^https://youtu.be/Raq3pbGmmOg?si=x4FHZ6SLIzWLfYh8][^https://youtu.be/ER1T5zMKG-g?si=TsHSYwHjxESBmPWN]

##### 1. Preparation

- For glueing narrow joints, you may make a thicker glue — for it not to run so much.[^https://youtu.be/XzlvPUTsWMY?si=Gcj3p_DKfSzjyxTi]

###### Bruné M. E.[^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=uoVaz-t1Sf3QF-Fn][^https://youtu.be/iYoLUvZ9SH8?si=RIdeXpLrUxZJAvjv]

1. Glue:water: 1:1.25.
2. Mix.
3. Close the lid (to prevent spillage, evaporation). 
4. Leave for 10–15 minutes.
5. Put it in the baby bottle warmer.
6. Add cold, room-temperature tap water up to the glue line.
7. Heat it up at 140°–145°F (60°–62.7°C) for a few minutes until the glue liquifies.
   - M. E. Bruné sets it at 142°–142.5°F[^https://youtube.com/shorts/u_IuTVtYOq8?si=fiGCmcaEkoGdgvNP] (= 61.1°–61.4°C) to account for the warmer’s swing of ±2.5°F. <br><br>
8. Conserve the extra in refrigerator 
9. Next usage: heat for 10–15 minutes.
   -  Reheatable ~4 times before losing strength.
10. When the glue has run out, clean the jar.

###### Erlewine D.

1. Glue:water: 1:≥1 / 1:2 (e.g., 1:2 oz).
2. Mix.
3. Close the lid tight.
4. Leave for 1.5–2 hours — until the granules absorb all the water and the glue looks like tapioca / brown sugar / fish eggs.
5. Heat up the glue in a pot at 145°–165°F (= 62.7°–73.9°C) for 2–4 hours until it becomes honey-like.
6. (Preferably) Leave it in the water of the turned-off pot for 12 hours. <br><br>
7. Store it in a refrigerator. 
8. Next usage: heat in a microwave for 30 seconds.

###### O’Brien R.[^https://youtu.be/stpmQfLrQPo?si=OxXlBS8mJTT1EFqV]

1. Glue:water: 1:1.9 by weight.
2. Leave for 30–60 minutes — for the glue to absorb the water.
3. Put the thermometer in the glue.
4. Put the glue jar either in:
   1. baby bottle warmer;
   2. pot;
   3. glue pot.
5. Heat the glue to 145°F = 60°C until it drips off the brush in almost an unbreakable line.
6. To conserve the temperature when removing the jar from the pot: put a few marbles into the glue jar.<br><br>

- Storage: close the jar, store in:
  - fridge — usable for several weeks until molding and smelling bad;
  - freezer — for longer storage.
    - May store in an ice cube tray.

##### 2. Glueing

1. Do 2–3 dry runs. Move fast.
2. Heat up the parts to be glued.
   - Glue pot / oil-filled heater / use a heat gun / desk lamp.
3. If the glue began to gel prematurely, add more glue.[^https://youtu.be/g7iK2OI2VE4?si=vFoVXSbZuFIn2pwb]
4. If the glue has hardened prematurely, heat it up and redo.

<br>

- After 20–30 minutes, the glued piece is handleable as long as it doesn’t receive much stress. → Can be un-clamped.[^https://youtu.be/XSa3WP2khUg?si=ByypWf3BvQF-a6w7]

##### 3. Cleaning

1. Clean up with a hot-watered rag as much as possible right after joining the parts.
2. Chip off, clean up with a hot-watered rag the remains.

### i.ii. Liquid[^https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/glue-and-adhesive/glues/wood-glues/titebond-liquid-hide-glue]

- Similar to hot hide glue, but longer working time.
- For:
  - repairability (= when the object will definitely need a repair later);
  - old instruments, when dealing with hide glue joints and hot hide glue’s working time is too short.

<br>

- Creeps starting at 100°F (37°C).[^https://youtu.be/iYoLUvZ9SH8?si=zbzhprr0rPI-qI4-] → M. E. Bruné disapproves.

#### Undoing[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

- Undoable with heat and moisture.

<br>

1. While unsettled, wipe with a hot-watered rag.
2. When settled, sand / scrape / chisel.

## i.ii. Fish

- [^https://youtu.be/Uozzynq9hPg]Collagen-based.
  - → Lots of the same properties of the hide glue.
  - → Rejuvenates with hot water. → Bonds to itself and hide glue.
- Longer open time than hide glue.

<br>

- Good for glueing:
  - wood to wood (e.g., fingerboard to the neck, braces to plates[^https://youtu.be/df-tDHxBTRQ?si=iQaBliQ7W3cZKWCq]);
  - metal to wood (e.g., carbon rods inside the neck);
  - plastic to wood (e.g., fingerboard binding to the fingerboard).[^https://youtu.be/N0HrIQKtVlI?si=sw1pDlJmMMiL5GMR]

<br>

- Thinning: for the wood to draw in the glue better, add very hot water to it before glueing.[^https://youtu.be/Uozzynq9hPg][^https://youtu.be/df-tDHxBTRQ?si=iQaBliQ7W3cZKWCq]

# ii. Synthetic

## ii.i. PVA / Aliphatic Resin 

<!-- 
15.2.2026. Verify each statement whether it's about PVA or aliphathic resin. Then separate these 2 categories. 
-->

- [^https://youtu.be/wHAOe-6vPO4?si=KFG1gLslC0hFiqe8]Relies on its thickness. → Fallible to starvation.
- More cantankerous with its flowingness than hide glue. → Should be applied onto both surfaces.[^https://youtu.be/tWKU0nM2LPE?si=dlqtNrHxe0yvUARW]

### Titebond

#### Original[^https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/glue-and-adhesive/glues/wood-glues/titebond-original-wood-glue]

- Strong.
- Working time: 5 minutes.
- Undoable with water and heat.

<br>

- Glueing time: 12 hours.

<br>

- Used on almost every guitar.

<br>

- When there’s too much glue under the bridge (even the classical one), Dan Erlewine dries it for 2 days.[^https://youtu.be/aoFdX_qw654?si=KUM1XffMcOuL23ST]

<br>

- The best glue for maple in terms of color.[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

#### III[^https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/glue-and-adhesive/glues/wood-glues/titebond-iii-ultimate-wood-glue]

- Stronger than Titebond Original. → For guitars that will be abused (e.g., touring).
- Waterproof. → Great for laminating wooden bindings before bending.
- Solvent-resistant.
- Working time: 10 minutes.

<br>

- The color blends nicely with walnut.[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

<br>

- The best all-around glue.[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

### * * *

- [^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]If PVA thickens up:
  - shake it vigorously;
  - (optional) add ≤5% of water.

<br>

- Wipe PVA with a cloth instead of paper, as the latter leaves pieces.[^https://youtu.be/oXN4RFExaWs?si=IKs12YqiHok_0-IU]

### Undoing[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

- **Unsettled**: can be wiped with a damp cloth, which can drive the PVA into the wood fibers. → The wood should be sanded afterwards.
- (Best) **Slightly settled**:
  1. let it set up a bit, to get a skin (10–20 minutes);
  2. remove it with a chisel / scraper / putty knife;
  3. wipe with a damp cloth;
  4. scrape / sand (before putting a finish on).
- Settled: 
  - chisel (risky);
  /
  - card / cabinet scraper;
  /
  - sand.

## ii.ii. CA[^https://youtu.be/Ni82f1-cAXg?si=r-mphW7UiSphqs38]

- **Cyanoacrylate** = **CA**.

<br>

- CA glue in the tube is a liquid of identical ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer molecules.
- When poured:
  1. fills every pore and crevice;
  2. monomers react with each other, forming polymer chains, = the liquid glue solidifies.

### Reaction

1. Ethyl cyanoacrylate has 2 double bonds.
2. The carbon double bond is attached to a nitrile group and an ester group.
3. → The chemistry of these groups make the carbon bond electron-deficient; the oxygen and nitrogen atoms attract electrons more than the carbons, leaving the carbon slightly *positively* charged.
4. → Carbon needs any electron source = something even slightly electro*negative* (= a negative ion) (often, it’s the oxygen atoms in the polar water molecule and the hydroxide ions in water) breaks open the carbon double bond.
   - = Electron deficiency makes the CA so reactive.
5. → 4 single bonds form.
6. → The negative nitrile and ester groups pull the extra electron across the molecule.
7. → This carbon becomes negative.
8. → Another, slightly positive carbon on a separate monomer is attracted.
9. → Monomers link together = a polymer chain emerges: the process from step 6 repeats for each new monomer.

<br>

- A negative ion is the reaction initiator.
- Many initiators → many short polymer chains.

### Properties

#### Strengths[^Iintentionally...]

- CA glue’s polymers are almost all single linear chains between the surfaces = directional like wood grain. Tension (compression) is uni-directional. → Polymer chains can deform enough. → CA glue is ==**strong in compression** — when pulled along the “grain”==.
  - Tensile strength can be >25 MPa — similar to other polymers (e.g., a 5×5 cm patch can suspend a fully grown African elephant).
- CA glue is about as hard as a safety helmet.

<br>

- Other glues (e.g., PVA, glue sticks) cure when the water *evaporates*, → have longer cure times. Inversely, the polymerization of CA glue is *triggered* by water, which is almost everywhere. →
  - CA glue ==cures fast (normally 10–30 seconds) on almost every surface==.
  - Water can’t undo the CA glue, but can only accelerate its curing. → ==Only acetone undoes CA glue==.

#### Weaknesses

- Needs to fill the surface’s crevices. → ==Poorly adheres to smooth surfaces==o==. → The surface needs, e.g., sanding==.

<br>

- (Fast cure’s downside:) The quick reaction produces short polymer chains that have a matrix with built-in stress. Stress in any material is a potential failure point.
  - Inversely, the polymer chains of polyethylene, polypropylene, nylons can deform, absorbing strong impacts.
- → Impacts break CA glue’s rigid polymer chains, and get absorbed in chains’ stress points. = ==CA glue is brittle==.

<br>

- Shear = compression + friction. = Unlike tension (compression), shear is not uni-directional = doesn’t get spread evenly: it's higher at the edges, lower in the middle. → The polymers can’t redistribute the stress. → Stress releases, breaking the polymer chains. = CA glue is ==**weak in shear** — when pulled perpendicular to the “grain”==.
  - Peeling back on one end of a surface applies all the force on a few polymers. → Chains break one by one. → ==If one glued end of a big enough surface breaks, the rest can easily break too==.

![alt text](Imagenes/Shear.png) <br>

- ==CA glue doesn’t adhere to chemically inert materials==: polythene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, Teflon.


<br>

- Recyclement: at 210°C, CA glue breaks back down into monomers that can be distilled and polymerize again.


#### Neutral

- As CA glue cures, it releases heat (especially on, e.g., cotton).

### Modifications

- Monomers are very runny (almost like water). → Thickening agents (e.g., fumed silica) increase viscosity, turning CA glue into a gel, and slowing down the cure.
  - To glue underwater, slow down the cure — use high-viscosity CA glue.
- Often, some acids are added to inhibit polymerization in the tube.
- Extra negative ions (e.g., accelerators, baking soda) speed up the cure.
  - Baking soda reacts with air moisture, producing hydroxide ions; + forms a very hard substance. → Strengthens joins, fills in gaps.
    - Pure water + CA glue = plastic droplets. <br>
    Pure water + baking soda + CA glue = long, fragile plastic.
  - Accelerators are basically baking soda dissolved in water.[^https://youtu.be/KHk9vQ0dvfU?si=BO0EH4M_tUtP4mEg]
- Dermabond (= medical CA glue): an increased a number of molecules in a carbon chain makes the monomers bond slower: 
  - cures slower;
  - heats less;
  - releases the toxins later (← longer polymers break down slower, → the wound can heal for the glue to be removed before the toxins are released);
  - less brittle (← longer polymers absorb stress better).

### * * *

- CA glue is a pH-based curing system. → Drying time depends on the wood’s acidity: the bigger the pH difference, the quicker it sets.[^https://youtu.be/KHk9vQ0dvfU?si=BO0EH4M_tUtP4mEg]

<br>

- Fragile. → Not for structural repairs.[^https://youtu.be/7ULld8sVj2Y?si=FdHxR-RbtxowEHz_]
- Readily reversible (with acetone).[^https://youtu.be/93Fw1SCg-CY?si=g_uTPz0J1LxImIE5]

<br>

- [^https://youtu.be/-HWCyqeygbU?si=6hGRppUbMtPe0pZq]For:
  - filling in the littlest pores of wood;
  - hardening softwood (e.g., maple, western red cedar);
    - changes the wood’s sound to more glassy-like;
  - as a finish.
- One of the few glues that binds bone to wood well. → Use for the bridge (ultra-thin).[^https://youtu.be/bQlGPr4t5dY?si=mertgRXhjZK7BBjl]

<br>

- Keep in the refrigerator.[^https://youtu.be/iYoLUvZ9SH8?si=evfHhySxK3Wlp-UN]

<br>

- Always wear safety glasses, latex gloves. Don’t breathe the CA’s fumes.[^Erlewine_D._Guitar_Player_Repair_Guide]

### Life[^https://youtu.be/-HWCyqeygbU?si=6hGRppUbMtPe0pZq]

| Unopened        | Opened           |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 year          | ~1 month         |

- To prolong life:
  - pull out air before closing;
  - close tightly;
  - put it in a freezer.

## ii.iii. Polyurethane[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l_(Titebond)]

- For:
  - **non-porous surfaces** (e.g., finish);
  - **wet wood** (≥10%) — because water activate the polyurethane glue;
  - **exotic oily woods** (immediately before glueing, sand the wood or wipe it with acetone / denatured alcohol, so that the oil didn’t have time to come out of the wood).

- Short shelf life. Get the air out of the bottle before closing to prolong the life.
- Foams up. → Needs high clamping pressure.

### Undoing[^https://youtu.be/19v2oBBEz-4?si=D4DbquOnTpTlL2-l]

1. While unsettled, paper towel with acetone / mineral spirits.
2. When settled, chisel / scrape / sand.

# * * *

- Not glueable:
  - packing tape[^https://youtu.be/g7iK2OI2VE4?si=B8E7Xu6ai3jNePvB];
  - paraffin paper.
