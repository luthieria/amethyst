- Wood is basically cellulose microfibrils bonded together by a “natural glue” lignin. → Glueing the broken wood back together is quite “natural”.[^Kert_Table]

<br>

- [^Whisperer]Time:
  - **open** (← “open joint”) — the glue remains liquid and workable;
    - joining parts after the open time results in a weak bond;[^Wikipedia_AnimalGlue]
  - **assembly** — open time + the time one has to manoeuvre the pieces after joining them together.
- **Glue starvation** — over-clamping causing the glue to come out of the joint. It will hold for a while (~25 years) before coming apart.[^Bruné_Glue]

<br>

- [^WoodKnight]Bonding to itself:
  - hot / liquid hide glue — yes;
  - PVA, epoxy — no.

<br>

- Water-based glues (e.g., Titebond Original) are dyeable with water-soluble dye. If it’s powder, mix it with water first.[^Whisperer]

<br>

- Lubricate the pins / threads with a paste wax to avoid glueing them.[^StewMac_Gluing]
- Cover a surface with a packing tape to avoid glueing it.[^StewMac_Gluing]

<br>

- Excess glue (e.g., on braces) can affect tone. → Clean up everything to be neat.[^O'Brien_TopBracing]

# Animal
## Hot Hide Glue[^StewMac_HideGlue][^StewMac_HideGlueBuy]
### Description

{{< expand >}}

Sumarizar: [Luthier Tips du Jour Mailbag 9 -  Hide Glue](https://youtu.be/stpmQfLrQPo?si=OxXlBS8mJTT1EFqV)

{{< /expand >}}

- Used since Ancient Mesopotamia = since the beginning of civilization (as opposed to PVA that appeared only after WWII). → Time-approved.[^Brune_Glue]

<br>

- Synthetic glues work mechanically, → leave a skim inside the joint, acting like velcro. Hot hide glue is protein-based, → the proteins absorb into the wood, “stitching” the cellular structure together as the long-chain proteins form.[^Brune_Glue1]

#### Advantages

1. **Repairability**:undoable cleanly an infinite number of times (with heat, moisture, hot knife), → makes an instrument repairable (as opposed to synthetic glues which may ruin the instrument).
2. For the **strongest** joints.
3. **No creep** under pressure (as opposed to PVA, which creates plastic joints that creep over time under heavy loads[^Wikipedia_AnimalGlue]).
4. **Cleans easily** with heat / steam / hot water.
5. Creates a somewhat brittle joint, → **cleanly breaks along the joint** (as opposed to PVA, which damages the glued surfaces[^Wikipedia_AnimalGlue]).
6. **Bonds to itself**, reactivates older hide glue.
7. **Functions as its own clamp**: once it begins to gel, it pulls the joint together.
8. **No glue starvation**.
9. **Good vibration** (→ tone) **transfer**.
10. **Very short working time**.
11. **Transparent**, → makes cracks invisible.

#### Disadvantages

1. Short open time.
2. Working time (before gelling up) — 2–3 minutes.
3. Thermal limitations.
4. Vulnerability to micro-organisms.

- Hide glue is just a liquid, → flows properly, → doesn’t need to be applied onto both surfaces (it will only produce more squeeze).[^Bruné_Tonewoods]
