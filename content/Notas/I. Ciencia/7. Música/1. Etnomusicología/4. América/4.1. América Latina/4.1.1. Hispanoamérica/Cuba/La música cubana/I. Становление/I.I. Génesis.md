# I.I. Génesis

- Most cubanos descend from:
  1. **españoles**: andaluces, canarios;
  2. **africanos**: yoruba, bantú.
- Small Cuban populations descend from:
  1. other **Caribbeans**;
  2. **French**;
  3. **Chinese**.

## 1. Amerindios

- **Arawak** = **taíno** — the most economically and socially developed Amerindians in Cuba.

<br>

- **Areíto** = **areyto** — 
  1. the main social event of Cuba, Quisqueya, Borinquen;
     - music, poetry, dance;
     - instruments:
       - mayohuacán;
       - güiro;
       - maracas;
       - (sometimes) flutes;
       - (sometimes) seashell trumpets;
      - varied depending on region and social occasion;
      - could last for days;
      - tequina (vocal / dance leader) + chorus of ~300 men and women, singing responsorially: the chorus repeated the tequina’s every line at a lower / higher pitch, while the tequina kept dancing in silence; the soloist could change; the narrative song could last uninterruptedly from one day to the next;
      - occasions:
        - making a petition (for e.g., crop fertility, protection from hurricanes);
        - rendering homage (e.g., Princess Anacaona’s areíto for the Hispaniola governor);
        - celebrating an important wedding / war victory;
        - solemnizing a funerary memorial;
        fostering recreation;
     - text: commemorating the past, the ancestors and their deeds, sometimes mentioning how each had died;
  2. (later) a religious celebration of music, dance, theater; dancers played maracas and may have worn rattles tied to their ankles.

<br>

- Voices:
  - elderly — low;
  - young — upper;
  - women — tenór, alto, soprano.

<br>

- Taíno singing was not harsh to European ears.
- It is unknown what taíno music sounded like, but historians have recorded some instruments. Apparently, there is no Amerindian influence in la música cubana.

<br>

- Taínos and Africans lived together as cimarrones. → Africans might have absorbed taíno musical elements:
  - drums, other instruments;
  - antiphonal singing;
  - ecstatic mass singing and dancing.

<br>

- **By the 1600s** — the Amerindians died out of:
exogenous diseases;
  - forced labor in the quest for nonexistent gold and silver;
  - mass suicide in response to the forced labor.

## 2. Españoles

- **27 October 1492** — Columbus discovered Cuba.
- Were arriving even in the early XX c.

<br>

- European influences:
  - chordal harmony;
  - sectional formal structures (rather than the reliance on cellular ostinatos);
  ensemble orchestration and arrangement;
  notation;
  - lots of written and orally transmitted music;
  - instruments;
    - guitarra is portable, → sailors brought it on ships to pass the time singing villancicos (— short song forms), romances (= corrido — Castillian narratives);
  - poetry;
    - the romance formed a basic layer of poetic sentiment and technique pervading the entire Hispanic world.

<br>

- Spanish culture was influenced by:
  - Africans;
  - Arabs (Syrians, Yemenites);
  - Berbers;
  - Jews;
  - Phonecians;
  - Greeks;
  - Gypsies;
  - Romans;
  - French;
  - Occitanians;
  - Celts;
  - Visigoths.

<br>

- The urban Caribbean music was influenced directly by the music of the Spanish court, theater, military, church.
- Música campesina throughout América Latina is almost entirely of Spanish origin.
- Sacred traditions (e.g., medieval choral and organ music) were brought to the Americas. The music of Spanish religious festivals (e.g., Corpus Christi) became a part of Cuban folklore.
- The military bands that came over with Spanish troops played an important role in musical life.
- The cultural interchange between Africans and working-class Spanish made African dances a part of the popular Cuban culture, slowly moving up towards upper-class acceptance.
- European instruments (piano, guitarra, flauta, violin, etc.) were incorporated into Cuban music in their original organological forms.
- The triple meter persists in some Hispanic-derived folk musics.
- Flamenco.
  - Version 1: there is no evidence that flamenco was transmitted to the Caribbean in the colonial period.
  - Version 2: XVI c. — flamenco was introduced to Cuba. Through flamenco, Middle Eastern and Indian rhythms, scales, instruments influenced e.g.:
    - Cuba: habanera, rumba;
    - Venezuela: joropo;
    - Mexico: jarabe.
